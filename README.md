# About venum_tds

Tds (`tds`) stands for Tabular Data Structures.

`venum_tds`is a small crate, that provides data structures for tabular data, rows, cells and various conversions for and between them. It utilizes venum's `Value` enum as the underlying data type, to achieve some level of "dynamic typing". This is needed for usage in, for example, Parsers.
